## Overview

### The challenge

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process
I started by doing the HTML & CSS then moved on to adding the functionality with JavaScript. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

I learnt how to make a Faq section. Previously I did not know how to do this. I do know that it is not perfect and work is definitely needed. I will work on the areas that have challenged me.



### Continued development

Keyboard Navigation & Mobile responsiveness

**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own plans for continued development.**
My plans are to come back to this and update my solution once I have improved on responsiveness skills.
